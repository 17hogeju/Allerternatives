Aller-ternatives is a mobile application for people with allergies to more easily search for food items that are safe for them to eat. It allows the user to enter in their allergens and food preferences and then search for either a grocery item or a restaurant food item/category that would normally contain the user’s allergen(s). The application can pull up grocery items that can alternatively be used if the user searched for a grocery item or restaurant menu items that do not contain the user’s allergen(s) if they are searching for restaurant food.

The app uses a Google API to collect data from grocery stores' websites. In the future, there will be the ability for certain restaurants to appear as “verified” by connecting with the creators of the application and submitting a special form that will collect data about how each menu item is prepared and what substitutions can be made.

In the future, the app will be available for iOS and Android devices and has been developed using the Dart programming language.
